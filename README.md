# EXPath Tools Java

XML tools for Java. Independent on any specific processor. The main
focus of this is to assist with writing EXPath implementations in Java.

For now, it is mainly a data model for abstracting XML nodes in Java.
It has been retro-fitted from other existing projects for extension
functions in Java (for Saxon, eXist-db and QuizX).  The model is still
ad-hoc now, and its design is not stable (nor good as far as I am
concerned).  The goal is to refactor it in successive iterations.
